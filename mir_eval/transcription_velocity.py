"""
Transcription evaluation, as defined in :mod:`mir_eval.transcription`, does not
take into account the velocities of reference and estimated notes. This
submodule implements a variant of
:func:`mir_eval.transcription.precision_recall_f1_overlap` which
additionally considers note velocity when determining whether a note is
correctly transcribed. This is done by defining a new function
:func:`mir_eval.transcription_velocity.match_notes` which first calls
:func:`mir_eval.transcription.match_notes` to get a note matching based on
onset, offset, and pitch. Then, we follow the evaluation procedure described in
[#hawthorne2018onsets]_ to test whether an estimated note should be considered
correct:

1. Reference velocities are re-scaled to the range [0, 1].

2. A linear regression is performed to estimate global scale and offset
   parameters which minimize the L2 distance between matched estimated and
   (rescaled) reference notes.

3. The scale and offset parameters are used to rescale estimated
   velocities.

4. An estimated/reference note pair which has been matched according to the
   onset, offset, and pitch is further only considered correct if the rescaled
   velocities are within a predefined threshold, defaulting to 0.1.

:func:`mir_eval.transcription_velocity.match_notes` is used to define a new
variant :func:`mir_eval.transcription_velocity.precision_recall_f1_overlap`
which considers velocity.

Conventions
-----------

This submodule follows the conventions of :mod:`mir_eval.transcription` and
additionally requires velocities to be provided as MIDI velocities in the range
[0, 127].

Metrics
-------

* :func:`mir_eval.transcription_velocity.precision_recall_f1_overlap`: The
  precision, recall, F-measure, and Average Overlap Ratio of the note
  transcription, where an estimated note is considered correct if its pitch,
  onset, velocity and (optionally) offset are sufficiently close to a reference
  note.

    This function first calls :func:`mir_eval.transcription.match_notes` to
    match notes according to the supplied intervals, pitches, onset, offset,
    and pitch tolerances. The velocities of the matched notes are then used to
    estimate a slope and intercept which can rescale the estimated velocities
    so that they are as close as possible (in L2 sense) to their matched
    reference velocities. Velocities are then normalized to the range [0, 1]. A
    estimated note is then further only considered correct if its velocity is
    within ``velocity_tolerance`` of its matched (according to pitch and
    timing) reference note.

        Array of MIDI velocities (i.e. between 0 and 127) of estimated notes
    onset_tolerance : float > 0
        The tolerance for an estimated note's onset deviating from the
        reference note's onset, in seconds. Default is 0.05 (50 ms).
    pitch_tolerance : float > 0
        The tolerance for an estimated note's pitch deviating from the
        reference note's pitch, in cents. Default is 50.0 (50 cents).
    offset_ratio : float > 0 or None
        The ratio of the reference note's duration used to define the
        offset_tolerance. Default is 0.2 (20%), meaning the
        ``offset_tolerance`` will equal the ``ref_duration * 0.2``, or 0.05 (50
        ms), whichever is greater. If ``offset_ratio`` is set to ``None``,
        offsets are ignored in the matching.
    offset_min_tolerance : float > 0
        The minimum tolerance for offset matching. See offset_ratio description
        for an explanation of how the offset tolerance is determined. Note:
        this parameter only influences the results if ``offset_ratio`` is not
        ``None``.
    strict : bool
        If ``strict=False`` (the default), threshold checks for onset, offset,
        and pitch matching are performed using ``<=`` (less than or equal). If
        ``strict=True``, the threshold checks are performed using ``<`` (less
        than).
    velocity_tolerance : float > 0
        Estimated notes are considered correct if, after rescaling and
        normalization to [0, 1], they are within ``velocity_tolerance`` of a

    "Correctness" is determined based on note onset, velocity, pitch and

    1. Its onset is within ``onset_tolerance`` (default +-50ms) of a

    2. Its pitch (F0) is within +/- ``pitch_tolerance`` (default one
