'''
The aim of a transcription algorithm is to produce a symbolic representation of
a recorded piece of music in the form of a set of discrete notes. There are
different ways to represent notes symbolically. Here we use the piano-roll
convention, meaning each note has a start time, a duration (or end time), and
a single, constant, pitch value. Pitch values can be quantized (e.g. to a
semitone grid tuned to 440 Hz), but do not have to be. Also, the transcription
can contain the notes of a single instrument or voice (for example the melody),
or the notes of all instruments/voices in the recording. This module is
instrument agnostic: all notes in the estimate are compared against all notes
in the reference.

There are many metrics for evaluating transcription algorithms. Here we limit
ourselves to the most simple and commonly used: given two sets of notes, we
count how many estimated notes match the reference, and how many do not. Based
on these counts we compute the precision, recall, f-measure and overlap ratio
of the estimate given the reference. The default criteria for considering two
notes to be a match are adopted from the `MIREX Multiple fundamental frequency
estimation and tracking, Note Tracking subtask (task 2)
<http://www.music-ir.org/mirex/wiki/2015:Multiple_Fundamental_Frequency_\
Estimation_%26_Tracking_Results_-_MIREX_Dataset#Task_2:Note_Tracking_\
.28NT.29>`_:

"This subtask is evaluated in two different ways. In the first setup , a
returned note is assumed correct if its onset is within +-50ms of a reference
note and its F0 is within +- quarter tone of the corresponding reference note,
ignoring the returned offset values. In the second setup, on top of the above
requirements, a correct returned note is required to have an offset value
within 20% of the reference note's duration around the reference note's
offset, or within 50ms whichever is larger."

In short, we compute precision, recall, f-measure and overlap ratio, once
without taking offsets into account, and the second time with.

IMPORTANT NOTE: the evaluation code in ``mir_eval`` contains several important
differences with respect to the code used in MIREX 2015 for the Note Tracking
subtask on the Su dataset (henceforth "MIREX"):

1. ``mir_eval`` uses bipartite graph matching to find the optimal pairing of
   reference notes to estimated notes. MIREX uses a greedy matching algorithm,
   which can produce sub-optimal note matching. This will result in
   ``mir_eval``'s metrics being slightly higher compared to MIREX.
2. MIREX rounds down the onset and offset times of each note to 2 decimal
   points using ``new_time = 0.01 * floor(time*100)``. ``mir_eval`` rounds down
   the note onset and offset times to 4 decinal points. This will bring our
   metrics down a notch compared to the MIREX results.
3. In the MIREX wiki, the criterion for matching offsets is that they must be
   within ``0.2 * ref_duration`` **or 0.05 seconds from each other, whichever
   is greater** (i.e. ``offset_dif <= max(0.2 * ref_duration, 0.05)``. The
   MIREX code however only uses a threshold of ``0.2 * ref_duration``, without
   the 0.05 second minimum. Since ``mir_eval`` does include this minimum, it
   might produce slightly higher results compared to MIREX.

This means that differences 1 and 3 bring ``mir_eval``'s metrics up compared to
MIREX, whilst 2 brings them down. Based on internal testing, overall the effect
of these three differences is that the Precision, Recall and F-measure returned
by ``mir_eval`` will be higher compared to MIREX by about 1%-2%.

Finally, note that different evaluation scripts have been used for the Multi-F0
Note Tracking task in MIREX over the years. In particular, some scripts used
``<`` for matching onsets, offsets, and pitch values, whilst the others used
``<=`` for these checks. ``mir_eval`` provides both options: by default the
latter (``<=``) is used, but you can set ``strict=True`` when calling
:func:`mir_eval.transcription.precision_recall_f1_overlap()` in which case
``<`` will be used. The default value (``strict=False``) is the same as that
used in MIREX 2015 for the Note Tracking subtask on the Su dataset.


Conventions
-----------

Notes should be provided in the form of an interval array and a pitch array.
The interval array contains two columns, one for note onsets and the second
for note offsets (each row represents a single note). The pitch array contains
one column with the corresponding note pitch values (one value per note),
represented by their fundamental frequency (f0) in Hertz.

Metrics
-------

* :func:`mir_eval.transcription.precision_recall_f1_overlap`: The precision,
  recall, F-measure, and Average Overlap Ratio of the note transcription,
  where an estimated note is considered correct if its pitch, onset and
  (optionally) offset are sufficiently close to a reference note.

* :func:`mir_eval.transcription.onset_precision_recall_f1`: The precision,
  recall and F-measure of the note transcription, where an estimated note is
  considered correct if its onset is sufficiently close to a reference note's
  onset. That is, these metrics are computed taking only note onsets into
  account, meaning two notes could be matched even if they have very different
  pitch values.

* :func:`mir_eval.transcription.offset_precision_recall_f1`: The precision,
  recall and F-measure of the note transcription, where an estimated note is
  considered correct if its offset is sufficiently close to a reference note's
  offset. That is, these metrics are computed taking only note offsets into
  account, meaning two notes could be matched even if they have very different
  pitch values.

    ----------
    ref_intervals : np.ndarray, shape=(n,2)

    est_intervals : np.ndarray, shape=(m,2)
        Array of estimated notes time intervals (onset and offset times)
    est_pitches : np.ndarray, shape=(m,)
        Array of estimated pitch values in Hertz
    onset_tolerance : float > 0
        The tolerance for an estimated note's onset deviating from the
        reference note's onset, in seconds. Default is 0.05 (50 ms).
    pitch_tolerance : float > 0
        The tolerance for an estimated note's pitch deviating from the
        reference note's pitch, in cents. Default is 50.0 (50 cents).
    offset_ratio : float > 0 or None
        The ratio of the reference note's duration used to define the
        offset_tolerance. Default is 0.2 (20%), meaning the
        ``offset_tolerance`` will equal the ``ref_duration * 0.2``, or
        ``offset_min_tolerance`` (0.05 by default, i.e. 50 ms), whichever is
        greater. If ``offset_ratio`` is set to ``None``, offsets are ignored in
        the evaluation.
    offset_min_tolerance : float > 0
        The minimum tolerance for offset matching. See ``offset_ratio``
        description for an explanation of how the offset tolerance is
        determined. Note: this parameter only influences the results if
        ``offset_ratio`` is not ``None``.
    strict : bool
        If ``strict=False`` (the default), threshold checks for onset, offset,
        and pitch matching are performed using ``<=`` (less than or equal). If
        ``strict=True``, the threshold checks are performed using ``<`` (less
        than).
    beta : float > 0
        Weighting factor for f-measure (default value = 1.0).
    chroma : bool
        Map reference and estimated pitches to chroma (Ignore octave errors)

    """Compute the Average Overlap Ratio between a reference and estimated

    The Average Overlap Ratio (AOR) is given by the mean OR computed over all
    matching reference and estimated notes. The metric goes from 0 (worst) to 1
    (best).

    Note: this function assumes the matching of reference and estimated notes
    (see :func:`match_notes`) has already been performed and is provided by the
    ``matching`` parameter. Furthermore, it is highly recommended to validate
    the intervals (see :func:`validate_intervals`) before calling this
    function, otherwise it is possible (though unlikely) for this function to
    attempt a divide-by-zero operation.
